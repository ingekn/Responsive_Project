            <h3>Why live consciously?</h3>
            <h2>What it means to Live Consciously</h2>
            <p>
              Living consciously means being aware of your thoughts and of your
              actions, your habits, and your reactions. It means becoming more
              aware of what you are thinking and doing, instead of acting
              impulsively and without thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conscious living also means being aware of what is happening
              around you, aware of the people around you, and the words they
              say. It means becoming more aware of the environment in which you
              are living, acting and working.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conscious living expands and sharpens your awareness of deep
              truths, the meaning of life, your inner self, and your real
              essence. It could also be the way to your own spiritual awakening.

              Hi, my name is Inge. I have always been interested in spirituality
              and lately have been learning more about ways to live consiously.
